###The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery.   

This project took a prior IdeaBox and pivoted it over to 2Do List built with Webpack. Emphasis was placed on user interface, accessibility, Sass as our preprocessor, and selenium for testing.   

**User Interface Specs**   
The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

**Accessibility Specs**   
The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.
